# Instructions for Transparent Background Images

## Next Steps:

1. **Save your 3 new transparent PNG images** on your Desktop with these exact names:
   - step-1-upload.png
   - step-2-ai-draft.png
   - step-3-funnel.png

2. **Once saved**, let me know and I'll copy them to the public folder automatically.

OR

You can manually copy them to:
/Users/johntimofeev/Desktop/Real Growth Labs/public/

The code has been updated to:
- Use PNG format (supports transparency)
- Changed background from grey to white (to show transparency better)
- Ready to display your transparent images

After the images are in place, refresh your browser to see them!
